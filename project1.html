                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The project involved designing and developing the Pej online ordering system for Parks and Resorts – a solution now used across all their amusement parks where online food ordering is available. The goal was to simplify and enhance the guest experience during food purchases, especially during peak seasons when lines and wait times tend to grow.

                        The result was a user-friendly interface that allows guests to order food directly from their phones without having to stand in physical queues. I was responsible for both the UX/UI design and the frontend implementation, which resulted in a fully functional product now used daily by thousands of visitors.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>The design process began with understanding both user needs and business requirements. I created wireframes to test different flows and layout ideas, which were then developed into high-fidelity prototypes in Figma. The main focus was to make the ordering process fast and frictionless – with clear navigation, simple choices, and strong visual hierarchy.

                        Once the design was approved, I implemented the layout using HTML and SASS, including visual styling and responsive behavior across devices.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The end result was an online ordering system now active across all Parks and Resorts locations where the service is available. The system has significantly simplified the ordering process, improved the customer experience, and reduced pressure on physical restaurant queues.

                        While I wasn’t provided with exact metrics, user feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Guests appreciate the clear structure and the ability to skip lines, while staff have reported increased efficiency in handling orders.</p>
