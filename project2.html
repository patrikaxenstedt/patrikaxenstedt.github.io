                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This project was created for a Sustainability Developer who needed a digital portfolio to showcase her consultancy work. The main challenge was to design a platform that would effectively communicate her expertise and the impact of her projects, making it easier for her to attract new clients. The solution was a clean, modern website that highlights her case studies, client testimonials, and unique approach to sustainability consulting.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Process</h2>
                    <p>The design process began with personal inputs from the client and market research to understand her target audience and how similar professionals present their work. I then developed wireframes to map out the structure and user flow, ensuring the content was easy to navigate and focused on credibility. High-fidelity mockups followed, reflecting a modern and minimal design style aligned with sustainability values. Finally, I conducted usability testing to refine the experience and ensure clarity, responsiveness, and intuitive navigation across devices. This is where my Frontend Developer skills come into play.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The final portfolio mockup effectively communicates the depth of her consultancy work in a clear and user-friendly way.</p>
